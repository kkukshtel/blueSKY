7DFPS Game based around Twitter OAuth Library

I slightly modified [Andrew Biggart's PHP code](https://github.com/andrewbiggart/latest-tweets-php-o-auth/) to accomodate some of my needs in Unity.

The code here just shows how you can use a WWW object in Unity to call to a server with PHP, assuming the crossdomain.xml file is in place. Final game is playable [here](http://kylek.itch.io/bluesky).
